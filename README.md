# CALCULATOR-iOS

**NAME:** SAMIKSHA SUDHAKAR SONUNE

**COLLEGE:** PEOPLE'S EDUCATION SOCIETY COLLEGE OF ENFINEERING CHH SAMBHAJINAGAR

**DESCRIPTION:** Calculator App

The Calculator App is a simple and intuitive application built using **Swift for iOS**. It provides essential **arithmetic functions** such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The interface is clean and user-friendly, making it easy for users to perform calculations quickly and efficiently.

**Features**-
The app supports basic arithmetic operations and includes features such as **percentage calculation** and the ability to **toggle between positive and negative numbers**. It also includes a **clear button** that resets all input and formatting of results to display with two **decimal places** when needed. Basic **error handling** is implemented to manage **invalid expressions**.

**Technologies Used**-
This project is built using **Swift** and **UIKit**. **Xcode** is used as the development environment, providing an intuitive interface and powerful debugging tools for building **iOS** applications.

**How It Works**-
The calculator works by allowing **users to tap numeric buttons to input values**. Arithmetic operations can be performed by **selecting the respective operators** such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. **Tapping the equals button** evaluates the expression and **displays the result**. The percentage button converts the current number to a percentage, while the plus-minus button toggles the sign of the number. The clear button resets the current input, allowing users to start fresh with a new calculation.

**Code Structure**-

The project is organized with the following structure:

**ViewController.swift** contains the main logic for handling user interactions and performing calculations.
**Main.storyboard** defines the user interface and connects the buttons to their corresponding actions.
**AppDelegate.swift** manages the appâ€™s lifecycle and initialization.

Known Issues - Currently, the app does not support complex operations such as parentheses or advanced mathematical functions. Additionally, it does not maintain a history of previous calculations, which may be considered for future updates.

Future Improvements - Potential improvements include adding support for advanced mathematical functions, implementing a history feature to store and display previous calculations, and introducing a dark and light mode to enhance the user experience.
